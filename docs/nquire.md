nQuire implements a set of commands to estimate ploidy level of individuals from species, where recent polyploidization occurred and intraspecific ploidy variation is observed. Specifically, nQuire uses next-generation sequencing data to distinguish between diploids, triploids and tetraploids, on the basis of frequency distributions at variant sites where only two bases are segregating.
