BBMap is a splice-aware global aligner for DNA and RNA sequencing reads. It can align reads from all major platforms â€“ Illumina, 454, Sanger, Ion Torrent, Pac Bio, and Nanopore. BBMap is fast and extremely accurate, particularly with highly mutated genomes or reads with long indels, even whole-gene deletions over 100kbp long. It has no upper limit to genome size or number of contigs, and has been successfully used for mapping to an 85 gigabase soil metagenome with over 200 million contigs.
