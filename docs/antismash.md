The antiSMASH framework allows the detection of clusters of co-occurring biosynthesis genes in genomes, called Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). BGCs often contain all the genes required for the biosynthesis of one or more Natural Products (NPs), also known as specialized or secondary metabolites. NPs show interesting biological activities and many of them have been developed into essential medicines, including antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin), anti-cancer drugs (bleomycin, doxorubicin), or cholesterol-lowering agents (lovastatin). This makes NPs and their encoding BGCs highly relevant from both a commercial and scientific perspective.
